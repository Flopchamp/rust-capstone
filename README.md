##  Project Overview

**Technology Chosen:** Rust Programming Language

**Project Type:** Command-Line Task Manager Application

**Why I Chose Rust:**
Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It's increasingly used in production at companies like Discord, Microsoft, and Amazon. I wanted to learn a language that offers both performance and memory safety without a garbage collector.

**End Goal:**
Build a fully functional CLI task manager that can:
- Add tasks with unique IDs
- List all tasks with status indicators
- Mark tasks as complete
- Persist data to a file between sessions
- Handle user input interactively
